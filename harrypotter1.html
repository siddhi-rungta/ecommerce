    <h3>About The Book</h3>
    <p>When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him 
      that apparently he's the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's 
      curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle 
      for Hogwarts, a wizarding school brimming with ghosts and enchantments, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery 
      when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing 
      powers which could be valuable, dangerous or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!
    </p>
